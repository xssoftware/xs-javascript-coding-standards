XS Software Javascript Coding Standard
====================================

These are code convention documents used in [XS Software](http://www.xs-software.com/) for Javascript modules. The base of the documents has been inspired from [Crockford's documents](http://javascript.crockford.com/code.html) and [Google's Javascript style guide](http://google-styleguide.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/javascriptguide.xml).
